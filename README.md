# SevenFlags
I made a queue file from scratch and then used it in the main program where visitors of Seven Flags line up for the rides. Queue placement is based on types of passes they have (gold, silver, none) and people can be in multiple lines if they have the right pass. Also displays a report based off of time increments to show what the lines look like as the day goes on.
